📘 S&P 500 ESG Risk Analysis – Full Documentation

---

1. Overview

This dashboard provides an environmental, social, and governance (ESG) risk assessment of companies in the S&P 500 index. The goal is to evaluate how exposed these companies are to sustainability-related risks and how this varies across industries, sectors, and company characteristics.

The dashboard was developed using Power BI and leverages visual analytics to make ESG risk data intuitive and actionable for both technical and non-technical stakeholders.

2. Purpose of the Analysis

The primary objectives were to:

• Measure the average ESG risk across the S&P 500  
• Compare companies by environmental, social, and governance sub-risk categories  
• Identify risk patterns by sector and industry  
• Understand how company size influences ESG risk  
• Visualize controversy levels affecting companies  
• Provide benchmarks for sustainable investment decision-making  

## 📁 Dataset Used

The dataset contains 12 months of sales records for 2021, including fields such as:

Dataset Columns:

• Sector – Broad industry classification
• Industry – Specific industry category
• Full-Time Employees – Total workforce size
• Total ESG Risk Score – Overall ESG risk rating
• Environment Risk Score – Risk associated with environmental factors
• Governance Risk Score – Risk linked to corporate governance practices
• Social Risk Score – Risk related to social responsibility and policies
• Controversy Level – Classification of company controversies
• Controversy Score – Numerical score reflecting controversy impact
• ESG Risk Percentile – Ranking compared to peers in terms of ESG risk

4. Major Dashboard Components (Explained in Simple Terms)
![Sales Report Dashboard](Sales%20Report.png)
Below is a breakdown of the dashboard visuals and what they convey.

🟢 4.1 ESG Risk Level Distribution

A donut chart shows the distribution of companies across ESG risk levels:

• Negligible  
• Low  
• Medium  
• High  
• Severe  

Interpretation:

• Most companies fall within the Medium and Low categories  
• This indicates a moderate but not severe ESG exposure across the index  

🟣 4.2 Controversy Level Breakdown

This chart highlights how companies are affected by ESG-related controversies such as environmental violations, lawsuits, workplace incidents, or governance scandals.

Controversy levels include:

• Low  
• Moderate  
• Significant  
• High  
• Severe  

Observation:

• Severe controversies are relatively rare  
• Moderate controversies are fairly common and can elevate ESG risk indirectly  

🟧 4.3 Employee Count vs ESG Risk

A combined bar and line chart explores how company size correlates with ESG risk.

Key takeaways:

• Very small firms often display low transparency in reporting  
• Medium to large firms tend to show higher ESG risk due to  
 • regulatory exposure  
 • supply chain complexity  
 • operational footprint  
• Extremely large firms show a slight decline in ESG risk due to strong governance and compliance frameworks  

🟦 4.4 Sector-Level ESG Risk

A treemap compares average total ESG risk across economic sectors.

Sectors with highest ESG risk:

• Energy (32.34)  
• Basic Materials (26.72)  
• Utilities (26.71)  

Sectors with lower ESG risk:

• Technology (16.92)  
• Real Estate (19.23)  
• Consumer Cyclical (approximately 19.23)  

Contextual alignment:

• Extraction and emissions-heavy sectors tend to face greater environmental and regulatory pressures  
• Service-oriented and technology sectors tend to face lower environmental risk and stronger governance standards  

🟨 4.5 Industry-Level ESG Ranking

A bar chart ranks specific industries by average total ESG risk.

Industries with highest exposure:

• Oil and Gas (various subsectors)  
• Metals and Mining  
• Chemicals  

Industries with lowest exposure:

• Medical and Pharmaceutical  
• Software  
• Financial Services  

These comparisons support ESG investing, risk assessment, and portfolio screening processes.

🌍 4.6 Global Theme Visualization

A central globe visual reinforces the global sustainability context by emphasizing that ESG considerations affect industries, regions, supply chains, and global markets.

📊 6. Results Interpretation

Key Findings:

• Overall ESG risk is moderate for the S&P 500, with an average score of 21.53  
• Social risk is the highest sub-risk category at 9.07, driven by labor, data privacy, human rights, and product safety concerns  
• The Energy sector is the most ESG-exposed sector due to operational and regulatory pressures  
• The Technology sector shows the lowest ESG risk driven by low emissions intensity and stronger governance maturity  
• Controversies play a significant role and often elevate total risk beyond operational fundamentals  
• Company size influences ESG complexity, as larger companies face broader scrutiny and regulatory obligations

💡 7. Business Implications

From the perspective of various stakeholder groups:

• For Investors: ESG risk scores support screening for sustainability-aligned equities and portfolio managers can structure ESG-optimized allocations  
• For Corporations: Companies can benchmark sustainability performance against industry norms  
• For Regulators: Industry trends reveal where governance policies require strengthening  
• For Public Stakeholders: Transparency builds trust, reputation, and social license to operate

🏁 8. Conclusion

The ESG Risk Analysis on the S&P 500 shows that most companies are not facing severe ESG distress. However, certain sectors, particularly Energy, Materials, and Utilities, face heightened sustainability pressures due to environmental exposure and regulatory scrutiny. Social and governance issues are rising in importance alongside environmental considerations. ESG risk has become a measurable factor that influences valuation, compliance strategy, and stakeholder perception across financial markets.
